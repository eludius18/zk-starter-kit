# ZK-STARTER-KIT

This repository serves as a starting point for developing applications using zero-knowledge (ZK) technology in Rust. It provides a minimal framework to help you get up to speed with the basics of ZK proofs and how they can be integrated into Rust-based projects.

## Introduction

Zero-knowledge proofs are a powerful cryptographic concept that allows one party to prove the validity of information to another without revealing the information itself. This starter kit is designed to:

- Help developers understand and implement basic ZK concepts.
- Provide a clean and modular Rust-based project setup for experimenting with ZK.
- Include examples and utilities for ZK proof generation and verification.

## Features

- Minimal Rust setup with a focus on zero-knowledge proof libraries.
- Example workflows for proof generation and verification.
- Configurable and extendable project structure.
- Performance-optimized builds using `cargo` commands.

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Rust** (latest stable version): [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- **Cargo** (comes with Rust installation)
- A supported operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eludius18/zk-starter-kit.git
   cd zk-starter-kit
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (if any). Dependencies are managed via the `Cargo.toml` file.

## Usage

### Build the Project

To compile the project in release mode:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This will create an optimized binary in the `target/release` directory.

### Run the Project

To execute the compiled binary:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

This will run the main application logic defined in the `src/main.rs` file.
